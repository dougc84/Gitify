gitify is a small application to save you a few steps in the development process.  By running gitify, you will add all new files (git add .), and commit them as well (git commit -am "your commit message").  By optionally adding the -p flag, it will perform a push (git push) as well.

I was always bothered by the fact I would have to type in:
git add .
git commit -am "something"
git push

So I decided to bundle it into one simple command.  Enjoy.

usage: gitify [-p] "your commit message"
   -p      Pushes git repository to master
   -fp     Flushes the .git/ cache and performs -p

examples:
   gitify "your commit message" - Add files and commit changes.
           runs:
           git add . && git commit -am "your commit message"
   gitify -p "your commit message" - Add files, commit changes, and push.
           runs:
           git add . && git commit -am "your commit message"
           git push
   gitify -fp "your commit message" - Flush .git cache, and performs -p
           runs:
           git rm -r --cached .
           git add . && git commit -am "your commit message"
           git push

I would recommend copying or moving the gitify script to somewhere globally accessible (/usr/bin is a great place), and then, of course, making it executible by running:

chmod +x /path/to/gitify

Then you're good to go.
