gitify is a small application to save you a few steps in the development process.
By running gitify, you will add all new files (git add .), and commit them as well
(git commit -am "your commit message").  By optionally adding the -p flag, it
will perform a push (git push) as well.

I was always bothered by the fact I would have to type in:
git add .
git commit -am "something"
git push

So I decided to bundle it into one simple command.  Enjoy.

usage: gitify [-p] "your commit message"
   -p      Pushes git repository to master"

examples:
   gitify "your commit message"
           runs:
           git add . && git commit -am "your commit message"
   gitify -p "your commit message"
           runs:
           git add . && git commit -am "your commit message" && git push

I would recommend copying or moving the gitify script to somewhere globally accessible
(/usr/bin is a great place), and then, of course, making it executible by running:

chmod +x /path/to/gitify

Then you're good to go.
